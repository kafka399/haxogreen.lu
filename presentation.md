What is data mining?
===
+ Discovery of new patterns

    - Cluster analysis  
    - Anomaly detection 
    - Rule mining
    - Regression
    - Summarization 

What is not data mining?
====

- Data management
- Data preprocessing
- Transformation
- Modeling / inference
- Visualization 

What is R language
===
+ Pros  

    - Open source
    - Community of millions of users and growing
    - Zillion of packages
    - Supports C++, Java, etc.
    - CLI

+ Cons

    - Steep learning curve
    - In-memory

Nearest neighbors
===
* Matlab
* Sas
* SPSS
* Stata
* Weka
* Python
* Mathematica
* MS Excel

Data sources 
===
+ Government

    - Data format - .pdf
    - Lagged data
    - Infrequent time-frame
+ Solutions
    - Hackathons/datedive
    - Data liberation movements

Public datasets
===

+ [Amazon public dataset](http://aws.amazon.com/datasets?_encoding=UTF8&jiveRedirect=1)
    - Wikipedia
    - 1000 Genomes
    - Common Crawl Corpus
    - Google Books Ngrams

+ [Google BigQuery](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/docs/overview)
    - GitHub

+ Others
    - Wikileaks
    - Twitter
    - Facebook
    - Kaggle

Data acquisition
===

* Web scraping (for ex.: Scrapy)
* RFID, public surveillance cameras
* Mobile phone(s)
* Honey spot as app., social network user

Big data 
====

+ Size matters
    - I start forgetting things - 5 GB
    - I need to move a lot of data - 300 GB
    - I'm stuck - 1 TB


+ Unstructured data - NoSql
+ Real time

Crunching big data - MapReduce
===

You and your 9 best friends are at National library. You are given 1 million of books and you need to find how many books have a title longer than 255 symbols?

* Divide randomly the books
* Separately, find all books matching the criteria and count them
* Get total answer

Why do you need 9 friends? 

My experience with big data
===

+ Google BigQuery
+ Amazon Aws
    - Hadoop
    - Hive


Computer security
======
+ Whats wrong with existing systems
    - Stunex, Flame, Duqu
    - Estonia, 2007
    - Operation Aurora, 2009

Computer security systems
===
+ Host
    - Low resources demand from host
    - Covers one machine
+ Network
    - High resources demand from server
    - Covers whole network

Types of network security systems
===
+ Misuse/Signature Detection
+ Anomaly Detection
    - Supervised learning
    - Unsupervised Learning
+ Hybrid Detection
+ Scan Detection
+ Profiling Modules

Signature detection & Supervised learning
==========================
+ Rule based
    - SNORT


Anomaly detection
===
![](http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w180/investuotojas/start_dec_anomalies.png)\  


Unsupervised learning
==========================
+ Clustering based
    - distance based (K-means, random Forest and etc.)
    - density based

+ Rule based
    - based on user profiles


Weakness of unsupervised learning
====

+ False positives
+ Alerts you, but doesn't provide the cause
+ Misbehaviour can be hidden


Feature selection
=========================
+ Basic features
    - source IP address
    - source port
    - destination IP address
    - destination port
    - protocol
    - flags
    - number of bytes
    - number of packets
+ Derived features
    - time-window
    - connection window based features

Hybrid systems
====

+ Signature based system
+ Unsupervised learning system
